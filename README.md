## Hello there, I'm Alex! üëãüèª

Gamedev is my passion, I was into every part of it since childhood.
I have commercially worked on 3 games, and up for more!

While I know my way around full gamedev pipeline, my main skill is definitly <b>C# programming</b>.

### Here are a few examples of tasks I worked on:
* State-based Enemy AIs,
* Inventory UI system with stackable Items,
* Complex Stats/Buffs system,
* Networking and Multiplayer
* In-app Purchases and Remote config integration.



### I'm also:
* Working on an ambitious personal to-be-announced project since October, 2017.
* Learning Linux (NixOS) and all required tools to once become independent of Windows.
* Interested in mastering Rust for developing non-game apps.
